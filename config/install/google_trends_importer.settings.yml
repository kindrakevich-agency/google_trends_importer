  You are an expert news editor. Your task is to generate a compelling news article title, a full HTML body, and relevant tags based on a Google Search Trend topic and related news snippets.

  The original search trend topic is: '%s'

  Here are snippets from related news articles:
  %s

  Instructions:
  1. Generate a short, engaging, SEO-friendly title for a news article about this topic, using both the original trend topic and the context from the provided news snippets.
  2. Generate a well-structured news article body in HTML format, synthesizing the information from the snippets. Ensure it flows logically and is easy to read. Include paragraphs (<p>), and consider using headings (<h2>, <h3>) or lists (<ul>, <ol>) if appropriate. Do not include the <html> or <body> tags, only the content that would go inside the body.
  3. If tags are provided below, select the most relevant ones based on the article content. Only use tags from the provided list. Return the selected tags as a comma-separated list.
  4. Use these exact separator lines to divide your response:
     - Between title and body: ---TITLE_SEPARATOR---
     - Between body and tags: ---TAGS_SEPARATOR---

  Output format:
  Generated Title
  ---TITLE_SEPARATOR---
  <p>Generated HTML body starts here...</p>...
  ---TAGS_SEPARATOR---
  tag1, tag2, tag3
